# flowgen
flowgen is an open-source tool that turns plain text into beautiful, structured flowcharts.  Designed for developers, writers, and technical communicators, flowgen lets you express logic, processes, or ideas in simple, readable textâ€”and automatically converts it into flow diagrams.

## Requirements
- Node.js 14 or higher
- Mermaid.js library

### Installation
Downloading and installing `Node.js` and `npm`: instruction [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Installing `Mermaid.js` using either yarn or npm:

Using yarn:
```sh
npm install --global yarn
yarn add mermaid
```
Using `npm`: `npm install` (under project root directory)

### Additional Requirements for MCP Server

To use the MCP server functionality, you'll need:

- An MCP client such as Claude Desktop ([download here](https://claude.ai/download))
- A valid MCP configuration file:
  - For Claude Desktop users: Follow the [setup instructions](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) to create your `claude_desktop_config.json`
  - For other MCP clients: Refer to your client's documentation for configuration details.

## Quick Start (without MCP)

1. Run the Build Process:
```sh
npm run build
```
2. Run the demo:
```sh
npm run render
```
It will genenerate a sample_output.png file in the build folder based on the sample.mmd file.

## Quick Start with MCP Server
1. Run the Build Process:
```sh
npm run build
```
2. Open the config file (such as `claude_desktop_config.json`) and add the following configuration:
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "filesystem": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
            "-y",
            "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
            "/path/to/flowgen"
            ]
        },
        "flowgen": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": [
                "/path/to/flowgen/build/index.js"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

3. Restart the MCP client. Now the MCP tooling should be available in the client.
